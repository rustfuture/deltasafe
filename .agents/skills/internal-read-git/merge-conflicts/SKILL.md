# Internal: Merge conflict resolution

**Read-only library.** **Local `git` only** (no **`gh`**). Use when **`@git-pull`** (or any parent) merges **`@{u}`** or **`ROOT_BRANCH`** and **`git`** leaves **unmerged paths**. **Ours** = current branch; **theirs** = the ref being merged (for example **`origin/main`** or a tracking branch).

**Consumers:** **[`@git-pull`](../../../git/pull/SKILL.md)** — run this file **in full** whenever conflicts occur; conflict resolution is part of **`@git-pull`**, not **`@git-push`**.

**Canonical merge phase:** `@git-pull` can merge in two phases (tracking branch first, canonical root second). In phase 2, prefer incoming (**theirs**) from `ROOT_BRANCH` in shared regions and adapt branch-only code around it.

---

## Principles

- **Never blindly checkout sides** — Read conflict markers manually (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`), especially in manifests (`package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `.gitignore`), where both sides' additions often need to be preserved together. Avoid `git checkout --theirs` / `--ours` across all files, which can silently wipe branch additions.
- **Accept what main/root brought** — For shared files and root-owned regions, default to **incoming (theirs)** unless a small local tweak is required for the branch to compile or meet its goal.
- **Avoid large rewrites of root code** — Do not replace big root blocks with older branch versions to “win” the merge. Keep root structure; adjust **branch additions** (new code, modules, tests) to fit.
- **Branch goal** — After merging, the feature or fix the branch exists for should still be achievable; adapt call sites, imports, and branch-only logic—not revert upstream refactors wholesale.

---

## Procedure (execute in order)

When any merge leaves unmerged paths:

1. **Confirm merge in progress** — `git status` shows unmerged paths.

2. **List conflicted files** — `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U` (or `git status`).

3. **Resolve each conflict**
   - **Read the files first** to see the markers. **Never** blindly run `git checkout --theirs` or `git checkout --ours` across all files, especially for manifests (`package.json`, `.gitignore`, `Cargo.toml`).
   - **Default to incoming (theirs)** for overlapping regions in files **main/root** owns (shared modules, config patterns, APIs updated on root). Prefer their version, then fix **branch-only** breakages (imports, types, tests) in the smallest follow-up edits.
   - **Adapt branch code** — For files that are mostly **branch work**, keep branch intent but align with new root APIs and layout (move code, update signatures) rather than restoring pre-merge branch snapshots of root files.
   - **Remove conflict markers** and leave one coherent result. **Do not** mass-reformat or restyle root code to match the branch; keep root formatting when you kept their side.

4. **Stage** — `git add <file>` for each resolved file.

5. **Complete merge** — `git status` has no unmerged paths; `git commit` (default merge message unless the user specifies otherwise).

Then continue from the **parent** step that triggered the conflict (e.g. **`@git-pull`** §3 or §5).

---

## Do not (library)

- **Fetch**, **merge** (except completing the in-progress merge via **`git commit`** after resolution), or **`git push`** — parent skill owns merge invocations; **`@git-push`** owns publish.
